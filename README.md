# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Steed

My portfolio website built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** — a hub for my projects and creative work.  

It includes sections for my blog, music, and games I've developed, all built within a performant and minimalist UI.

You can start editing the Home page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can add/remove pages by adding/removing folders under `src/app`. Make sure these folders have a `page.tsx` included.

For your own blog posts, simply add your own Markdown files under `/posts`. Ensure your front matter includes **title** and **date** fields. You can reference my blog posts for example.
